intro = "We hold the faith which is common to all the believers (Titus 1:4, Jude 3):"

Bible = "The Bible is the complete divine revelation inspired word by word by God through the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21, 2 Tim. 3:16)"

Truine_God = "God is uniquely one, yet Triune: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (1 Tim. 2:5a, Matt. 28:19)"

Jesus_Christ = "The Son of God, even God Himself, was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus Christ (John 1:1, John 1:14)"

Crucifixion = "Christ died on the cross for our sins, shedding His blood for our redemption (1 Pet. 2:24,  Eph. 1:7a)"

Resurrection = "Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day (1 Cor. 15:4)"

Ascension = "Christ ascended to the right hand of God to be Lord of all (Acts 1:9, Acts 2:33, Acts 2:36)"

Salvation = "Whenever any person repents to God and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he is regenerated (born again) and becomes a living member of the one Body of Christ (Acts 20:21, John 3:3, Eph. 1:22-23, Rom. 12:5)"

Christ_Return = "Christ is coming again to receive His believers to Himself (1 Thes. 2:19)"


LSM_statement_of_faith = """Holding the Bible as the complete and only divine revelation, we strongly believe that 
God is eternally one and also eternally the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three being distinct but not separate. 
We hold that Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man. Without abandoning His divinity, He was conceived 
in the womb of a human virgin, lived a genuine human life on earth, and died a vicarious and all-inclusive death on the 
cross. After three days He resurrected bodily and has ascended to the heavens. He is now in glory, fully God but still 
fully man. We look to His imminent return with the kingdom of God, by which He will reign over the earth in the 
millennium and in eternity. We confess that the third of the Trinity, the Spirit, is equally God. All that the Father 
has and is, is expressed by the Son; and all that the Son has and is, is realized as the Spirit. We further believe 
that mankind is in need of God's salvation. Though we were absolutely unable to fulfill the heavy demands of God's 
righteousness, holiness, and glory, Christ fulfilled all the requirements through His death on the cross. Because of 
Christ's death, God has forgiven us of our sins, justified us by making Christ our righteousness and reconciled us to 
Himself. Based on Christ's redemption, God regenerates the redeemed with His Spirit to consummate His salvation, that 
they may become His children. Now possessing God's life and nature, the believers enjoy a daily salvation in His Body 
in this age and the eternal salvation in the coming age and in eternity. In eternity we will dwell with God in the New 
Jerusalem, the consummation of God's salvation of His elect."""
